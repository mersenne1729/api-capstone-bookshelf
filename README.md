#  Jerome’s Bookshop

## Synopsis

Seeing if I can uses an API and had some fun with the Everyman’s Library classic books theme.

## Everyman

During the later part of the 19th century and the early 20th century, several publishing houses came across the idea of making, what was known at the time as the Western canon of books (a collection of books that that scholars generally accept as the most important and influential in shaping the Western culture), available to everyone in society. The Everyman’s Library is one of the most prominent series, and this site is made to introduce users to the books and authors in this catalogue of classical texts, via an open platform API. 

The initial mobile and desktop wireframes can be seen below:

## Technical

The project is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Node.js. It makes use of JSON calls to the *Wikipedia* Open Platform API to return the data. All data is held in memory during the user's session.
