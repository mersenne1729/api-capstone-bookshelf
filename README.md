#  Jerome’s Bookshop

### Background
During the latter part of the 19th century and early 20th century several publishing houses came across the idea of making what was Noah at the time the Western Canon available to everyone in Society. Of particular prominence were the Oxford world classics Penguin Classics, the Modern Library and Everyman’s Library. In 1905 Joseph Malaby Dent of the Everyman library Made it his goal to catalogue create this Canon that would appeal to every kind of person, from students to the working classes to the cultural elite. Now long forgotten this app attempts to small steps towards introducing this forgotten Canon. Currently all of the information is drawn from open platform API and could be found with a quick Google search, however, in later versions the level of detail and options will be greatly increased.


## Use Case

The app's functionality includes:

* Listing all callable data via *Wikipedia* on any given search query with links to the requested data.

The app is built with HTML, CSS, Java Script, jQuery and Node it makes use of JSON calls to the *Wikipedia* Open Platform APIs to return the data. All data is held in memory during the user's session. It has been built to be fully responsive across mobile, tablet and desktop screen resolutions.
